purchase.
○ The item(s) the user will buy will be added to a cart until they are ready
for checkout.
● Provide a way for the user to check out and view their cart.
● Give the subtotal, sales tax, and the total.
● If the user is paying in cash, ask for the amount tendered and provide
change.

CVV.
● Provide a receipt for the payment which includes the item(s) bought, the
subtotal, total, and anything else of interest.
